## About me
I work as a back-end engineer @DHL Ecommerce the Netherlands. I specialize in developing cloud-native applications in event-driven landscapes. I started my career as an Aerospace engineer and after obtaining my PhD in the same field, I switched to Software Engineering permanently. 

I have a strong preference for functional programming, but at the same time try to stress that this doesn't mean that we cannot use object oriented programming. I love working with different languages to learn their quirks, but more importantly the idea and philosophy behind a language.

Feel free to reach out over e-mail, or through LinkedIn if you have any question or suggestion for this website!

## About this website
I've founded this website for two reasons: share the knowledge I've gained over the years and as a way to keep improving my own skill. The thing is, when you are developer it is easy to stick to what you already know. So join me in this endeavor to keep learning, to build some stuff and to break some stuff along the way.
